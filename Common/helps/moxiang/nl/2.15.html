                "The battery life of the camera depends on how often the camera works. The more often the camera is woken up to work, the faster the battery will be used up. According to laboratory test data, the battery can be used for 3-5 months if the camera is stimulated to wake up 15 times a day. If your camera's battery drains very quickly, please check whether the camera is triggered too often. It is recommended to place the camera in a work environment with a smooth and stable network."
