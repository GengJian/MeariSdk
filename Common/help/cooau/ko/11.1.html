                "The battery life of the camera depends on the times the camera works. The more times the camera is wakes up, the faster the battery will be consumed. According to laboratory test data, if the camera is triggered 15 times a day, the battery can be used for 3-5 months. If your camera battery drains very quickly, please check if the camera is triggered too many times. It is recommended to place the camera in a working environment with a smooth and stable network."
